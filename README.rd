# OVERVIEW
========
QVD (Quality Virtual Desktop) is a highly scalable, cost effective, easy to manage, open source VDI solution developed by Qindel Group, 
built on top of Linux.

Its main purpose is to access Linux remote desktops through a Linux-focused VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure). The primary focus is that 
the infrastructure and the desktops presented to the end user are both in Linux.
We maintain a copy of our source code in GitHub for your benefit, while our main development is still done outside of GitHub.


# **FOR THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY**
=============================
QVD has three different editions: Developer, Self-Support and Enterprise. 
You are now in the GitHub channel of QVD which is for Developer edition users. It is a free edition aimed at those with a developer profile, 
self-employed or employed, who have the knowledge and the necessary time to deploy QVD and update it on their own.
